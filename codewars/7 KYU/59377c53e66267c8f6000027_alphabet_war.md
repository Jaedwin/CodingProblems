## Description

A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

## Ruby
```ruby
VALUES = { 'w' => 4, 'm' => 4, 'p' => 3, 'q' => 3, 'b' => 2, 'd' => 2, 's' => 1, 'z' => 1 }

def alphabet_war(fight)
  left = []
  right = []
  
  fight.chars.each { |char| %w(w p b s).include?(char) ? left << char : %w(m q d z).include?(char) ? right << char : next }
  
  left_count = left.map { |char| VALUES[char] }.inject(:+).to_i 
  
  right_count = right.map { |char| VALUES[char] }.inject(:+).to_i
  
  if left_count > right_count
    return "Left side wins!"  
  elsif left_count < right_count
    return "Right side wins!"
  else
    return "Let's fight again!"
  end
