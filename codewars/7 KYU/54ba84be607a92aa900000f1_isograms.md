## Description

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```ruby
is_isogram("Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
is_isogram("aba" ) == false
is_isogram("moOse" ) == false # -- ignore letter case
```

# Solution (in Ruby)

```ruby
def is_isogram(string)
  string.downcase.chars.uniq.length == string.chars.length
end
```
