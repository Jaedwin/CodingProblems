## Description

Your task is to escape from the carpark using only the staircases provided to reach the exit. You may not jump over the edge of the levels (youâ€™re not Superman!) and the exit is always on the far right of the ground floor.

Rules:

```ruby
1. You are passed the carpark data as an argument into the function.

2. Free carparking spaces are represented by a 0

3. Staircases are represented by a 1

4. Your parking place (start position) is represented by a 2

5. The exit is always the far right element of the ground floor.

6. You must use the staircases to go down a level.

7. You will never start on a staircase.

8. The start level may be any level of the car park.

9. Each floor will have only one staircase apart from the ground floor which will not have any staircases.
```

Returns:

```ruby
Return an array of the quickest route out of the carpark

R1 = Move Right one parking space.

L1 = Move Left one parking space.

D1 = Move Down one level.
```

Example:

Initialise: 

```ruby
carpark = [[1, 0, 0, 0, 2],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]
```

Working Out:

```ruby
- You start in the most far right position on level 1
- You have to move Left 4 places to reach the staircase => "L4"
- You then go down one flight of stairs => "D1"
- To escape you have to move Right 4 places => "R4"
```

```ruby
result = ["L4", "D1", "R4"]
```

Result:

# Solution (in Ruby)

```ruby
def escape(carpark)
  # Tracking
  output = []
  beginPos = nil
  stairPos = nil
  
  # Get # of floors
  numOfFloors = carpark.length
  numOfSpots = carpark.first.length
  
  return [] if numOfFloors == 1
  
  # Traverse down through floors
  carpark.each_with_index do |floor, index|  
  
    floor.each_with_index do |spot, index|
      beginPos = index if spot == 2
      stairPos = index if spot == 1
    end
    
    # Skip floors until on the starting floor
    next if beginPos.nil?
    
    # If on the first floor (last element in the array)
    if (numOfFloors-1 - index).zero?
      puts "#{numOfSpots}, #{beginPos+1}"
      distanceToExit = numOfSpots - (beginPos+1)
      output << 'R' + distanceToExit.abs.to_s unless distanceToExit == 0
      break
    end
    
    distanceToMove = beginPos - stairPos
    beginPos = stairPos
      
    if distanceToMove.positive?
      output += ['L' + distanceToMove.abs.to_s, 'D1']
    elsif distanceToMove.negative?
      output += ['R' + distanceToMove.abs.to_s, 'D1']
    else
      output << "D#{output.pop.split('D').last.to_i + 1}"
    end 
  end
  output
end
```
