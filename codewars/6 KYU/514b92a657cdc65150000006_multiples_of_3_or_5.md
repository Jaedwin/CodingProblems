## Description

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)


# Solution (in Ruby)

```ruby
def solution(number)
 (multiples_of_x(number,5) + multiples_of_x(number,3)).uniq.reduce(:+)
end

def multiples_of_x(num,x)
  (1..num-1).select { |n| n % x == 0 } 
end
```
