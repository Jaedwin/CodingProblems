## Description

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function `likes :: [String] -> String`, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

```ruby
likes [] -- must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] -- must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] -- must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] -- must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] -- must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
```

# Solution (in Ruby)

```ruby
def likes(names)
  return "no one likes this" if names.empty?
    
  case names.length
  when 1
    names.first + " likes this"
  when 2
    names.join(' and ') + " like this"
  else
    pluralize(names)
  end
end

def pluralize(names)
  names.length == 3 ? names.slice(0,2).join(', ') + " and #{names.last} like this" : names.slice(0,2).join(', ') + " and #{names.count - 2} others like this"
end
```
